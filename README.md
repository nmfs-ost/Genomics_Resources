This is a shared repository to facilitate gathering resources useful for ongoing genomics work at across NMFS. 

Initial plans are to:

- [Omics tutorials](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/Genomics_Resources/tree/main/tutorials)
    - Gather and link to existing tutorials and code relevant to lcWGS, gt-seq, etc.
    - Write short tutorials for running various scripts that would broadly useful across many analyses (fastqc, trimming, bwa mem, etc).
    - Develop specific tutorials for topics specific to various groups 
- Gather a running database of omics publications and associated code: [Found here](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/Genomics_Resources/tree/main/publications)
